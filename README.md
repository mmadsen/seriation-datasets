Datasets for frequency, occurrence, and continuity seriation methods


Our goal in this repository is to collect publicly available data sets that are suitable for developing and testing archaeological seriation algorithms.  In all cases, we provide citations in both RIS and BibTeX format for the published source from which we extracted the data.  In many cases, that published source may not be the original field report or excavation report, but instead a later journal article or secondary source, but every effort has been made to provide sufficient references to allow an investigator to trace the data back to the original source.
